# HtmlFalloutHackingHelper

An HTML tool to help hacking Fallout 3+ terminals

First, write all the words found in the hacking terminal.
Second, select on Fallout one of the "best words" proposed by the app, get the number of common letters, click on that group, and repeat!

Note: Usually, The number of words is "constant", from one terminal to the other (this might change depending on your hacking skills, the difficulty, or even the game itself, but this is constant otherwise). So if the number of words you inserted manually is different from what you see, maybe you forgot one...
